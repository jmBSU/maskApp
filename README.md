
# Mask Data Terminal

This app is a repurposed version of SimpleBluetoothLETerminal: [Github](https://github.com/kai-morich/SimpleBluetoothLeTerminal)

The major changes would be mostly cosmetic, since the terminal was changed to fit the data type that is used in this project. Also, instead of getting all serial data, it parses by newlines and provide number values instead.
